Build Script Plan
----------------------------
Sometimes you are interested in which tasks are executed in which order for a
given set of tasks specified on the command line, but you don't want the tasks
to be executed. You can use the -m option for this. For example, if you run
“gradle -m clean compile”, you'll see all the tasks that would be executed as
part of the clean and compile tasks. This is complementary to the tasks task,
which shows you the tasks which are available for execution.
