Listing Tasks
-------------------------
Running `gradle tasks` gives you a list of the main tasks of the
selected project. This report shows the default tasks for the
project, if any, and a description for each task.

Below is an example of this report:

gradle -q tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
All tasks runnable from root project
------------------------------------------------------------

Default tasks: dists

Build tasks
-----------
clean - Deletes the build directory (build)
dists - Builds the distribution
libs - Builds the JAR

Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build. [incubating]
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files. [incubating]

By default, this report shows only those tasks which have been assigned
to a task group, so-called visible tasks. You can do this by setting the group
property for the task. You can also set the description property,
to provide a description to be included in the report.

Example 4.11. Changing the content of the task report

build.gradle
dists {
    description = 'Builds the distribution'
    group = 'build'
}
