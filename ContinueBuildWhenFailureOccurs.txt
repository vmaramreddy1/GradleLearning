Continuing the build when a failure occurs
--------------------------------------------
1. By default, Gradle will abort the execution and fail the build
   as soon as any task fails.
2. In order to discover as many failures as possible in a single build execution ,
    we can use the --continue option.
3. When executed with --continue, Gradle will execute every task
   to be executed where all of the dependencies for that task
   completed without failure, instead of stopping as soon as the
   first failure is encountered. Each of the encountered failures 
   will be reported at the end of the build.
