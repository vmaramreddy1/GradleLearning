Profiling a build
--------------------------
The --profile command line option will record some useful timing information
while your build is running and write a report to the build/reports/profile directory.
The report will be named using the time when the build was run.

This report lists summary times and details for both the configuration phase and
task execution. The times for configuration and task execution are sorted with
the most expensive operations first. The task execution results also indicate
if any tasks were skipped (and the reason) or if tasks that were not skipped
did no work.

Builds which utilize a buildSrc directory will generate a second profile report
for buildSrc in the buildSrc/build directory.
