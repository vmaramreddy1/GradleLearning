Selecting which build to execute
-----------------------------------
When you run the gradle command, it looks for a build file in the
urrent directory. You can use the -b option to select another build
file. If you use -b option then settings.gradle file is not used

Example:subdir/myproject.gradle
task hello {
  doLast {
    println "using build file '$buildFile.name' in '$buildFile.parentFile.name'"
  }
}

output of gradle -q -b subdir/myproject.gradle hello
>gradle -q -b subdir/myproject.gradle hello
using build file 'myproject.gradle' in 'subdir'


* -q / --quiet command line switch indicates
gradle to run the task quietly and show only errors if occured.
