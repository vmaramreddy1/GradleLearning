Forcing tasks to execute
-------------------------------
Many tasks, particularly those provided by Gradle itself,
support incremental builds. Such tasks can determine whether
they need to run or not based on whether their inputs or outputs
have changed since the last time they ran.

You can easily identify tasks that take part in incremental build
when Gradle displays the text UP-TO-DATE next to their 
name during a build run.

You may on occasion want to force Gradle to run all the tasks,
ignoring any up-to-date checks. If that's the case,
simply use the --rerun-tasks option.
