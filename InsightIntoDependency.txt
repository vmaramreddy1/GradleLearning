Getting the insight into a particular dependency
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Running `gradle dependencyInsight` gives you an insight into a particular dependency
(or dependencies) that match specified input. Below is an example of this report:

> gradle -q webapp:dependencyInsight --dependency groovy --configuration compile
org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.7
\--- project :api
     \--- compile


This task is extremely useful for investigating the dependency resolution,
finding out where certain dependencies are coming from and why certain
versions are selected. For more information please see the
DependencyInsightReportTask class in the API documentation.


The built-in dependencyInsight task is a part of the 'Help' tasks group.
The task needs to be configured with the dependency and the configuration.
The report looks for the dependencies that match the specified dependency spec
in the specified configuration. If Java related plugins are applied,
the dependencyInsight task is pre-configured with the 'compile' configuration
because typically it's the compile dependencies we are interested in.
You should specify the dependency you are interested in via the command line
'--dependency' option. If you don't like the defaults you may select the
configuration via the '--configuration' option. For more information see the
DependencyInsightReportTask class in the API documentation.
